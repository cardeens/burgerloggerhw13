Node Express Handlebars - Homework 13

## Description 

This assignment had us create an end-to-end application using Express Handlebars, Node, and MySQL. This gave us to opportunity to put together a CRUD application that would use data stored in a server we created. We could also quickly create a dynamic front-end experience using Handlebars. 

## Installation

In order to use the applicaiton, use the deployed URL. This will allow the user to interact with the app and access the data deployed with Heroku. 

## Usage

The user will be presented with some burger options that are already stored in the server. They will either be in the "Devoured" or "Still There" sections depending on the status they've been assigned. The user can change these designations by clicking the "Devour It" button, or "Bring it Back". They can also add a new burger with the text field at the bottom of the application, and choose whether it's already been devoured or not.
